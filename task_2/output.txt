GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016
Introduction
A. Overview
This Standard is part of the set of GRI Sustainability
Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). These Standards
are designed to be used by organizations to report
about their impacts on the economy, the environment,
and society.
The GRI Standards are structured as a set of
interrelated, modular standards. The full set can be
downloaded at www.globalreporting.org/standards/
There are three universal Standards that apply to every
organization preparing a sustainability report:
GRI 101: Foundation
GRI 102: General Disclosures
GRI 103: Management Approach
GRI 101: Foundation is the starting point for using
the GRI Standards. It has essential information
on how to use and reference the Standards.

An organization then selects from the set of topic-
specific GRI Standards for reporting on its material
topics. These Standards are organized into three series:
200 (Economic topics), 300 (Environmental topics) and
400 (Social topics).
Each topic Standard includes disclosures specific to
that topic, and is designed to be used together with
GRI 103: Management Approach, which is used to
report the management approach for the topic.
GRI 201: Economic Performance is a topic-specific
GRI Standard in the 200 series (Economic
topics).
B. Using the GRI Standards and making claims
There are two basic approaches for using the GRI
Standards. For each way of using the Standards there
is a corresponding claim, or statement of use, which
an organization is required to include in any published
materials.
1. The GRI Standards can be used as a set to prepare
a sustainability report that is in accordance with
the Standards. There are two options for preparing
a report in accordance (Core or Comprehensive),
depending on the extent of disclosures included in
the report.
An organization preparing a report in accordance
with the GRI Standards uses this Standard,
GRI 201: Economic Performance, if this is one of its
material topics.
2. Selected GRI Standards, or parts of their content,
can also be used to report specific information,
without preparing a report in accordance with
the Standards. Any published materials that use
the GRI Standards in this way are to include a
"GRI-referenced" claim.
See Section 3 of GRI 101: Foundation for more
information on how to use the GRI Standards,
and the specific claims that organizations are
required to include in any published materials.

C. Requirements, recommendations and guidance
The GRI Standards include:
Requirements. These are mandatory instructions.
In the text, requirements are presented in bold font
and indicated with the word 'shall'. Requirements are
to be read in the context of recommendations and
guidance; however, an organization is not required to
comply with recommendations or guidance in order
to claim that a report has been prepared in accordance
with the Standards.
Recommendations. These are cases where a particular
course of action is encouraged, but not required. In the
text, the word 'should' indicates a recommendation.
Guidance. These sections include background
information, explanations and examples to help
organizations better understand the requirements.
An organization is required to comply with all applicable
requirements in order to claim that its report has been
prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards. See
GRI 101: Foundation for more information.
D. Background context
In the context of the GRI Standards, the economic
dimension of sustainability concerns an organization's
impacts on the economic conditions of its stakeholders,
and on economic systems at local, national, and
global levels.
The Standards in the Economic series (200) address
the flow of capital among different stakeholders,
and the main economic impacts of an organization
throughout society.
GRI 201 addresses the topic of economic performance.
This includes the economic value generated and
distributed (EVG&D) by an organization; its defined
benefit plan obligations; the financial assistance it
receives from any government; and the financial
implications of climate change.
These concepts are covered in key instruments of
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development: see References.
The disclosures in this Standard can provide information
about an organization's impacts related to economic
performance, and how it manages them.
GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016
GRI 201:
Economic Performance
This Standard includes disclosures on the management approach and topic-specific
disclosures. These are set out in the Standard as follows:
Management approach disclosures (this section references GRI 103)
Disclosure 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed
Disclosure 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities
due to climate change
Disclosure 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans
Disclosure 201-4 Financial assistance received from government
1. Management approach disclosures
Management approach disclosures are a narrative explanation of how an organization manages a material topic,
the associated impacts, and stakeholders' reasonable expectations and interests. Any organization that claims its
report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report on its management approach
for every material topic, as well as reporting topic-specific disclosures for those topics.
Therefore, this topic-specific Standard is designed to be used together with GRI 103: Management Approach in order
to provide full disclosure of the organization's impacts. GRI 103 specifies how to report on the management approach
and what information to provide.
Reporting requirements
1.1
The reporting organization shall report its management approach for economic performance using
GRI 103: Management Approach.

2. Topic-specific disclosures
An organization is expected to compile information for economic disclosures using figures from its audited
financial statements or from its internally-audited management accounts, whenever possible. Data can be
compiled using, for example:
the relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), published by the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB), and the Interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee
(specific IFRS are referenced for some of the disclosures);
the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation
of Accountants (IFAC);
national or regional standards recognized internationally for the purpose of financial reporting.
Disclosure 201-1
Direct economic value generated and distributed
Reporting requirements
The reporting organization shall report the following information:
a. Direct economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) on an accruals basis, including the
basic components for the organization's global operations as listed below. If data are presented
on a cash basis, report the justification for this decision in addition to reporting the following
basic components:
i.
ii.
Direct economic value generated: revenues;
Economic value distributed: operating costs, employee wages and benefits,
payments to providers of capital, payments to government by country, and
community investments;
iii. Economic value retained: 'direct economic value generated' less 'economic value
distributed'.
and the criteria used for defining significance.
When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 201-1, the reporting organization shall,
if applicable, compile the EVG&D from data in the organization's audited financial or profit and
loss (P&L) statement, or its internally audited management accounts.
b. Where significant, report EVG&D separately at country, regional, or market levels,
2.1
Guidance
Background
Information on the creation and distribution of
economic value provides a basic indication of how
an organization has created wealth for stakeholders.
Several components of the economic value generated
and distributed (EVG&D) also provide an economic
profile of an organization, which can be useful for
normalizing other performance figures.
If presented in country-level detail, EVG&D can provide
a useful picture of the direct monetary value added to
local economies.
GRI 201: Economic Performance 2016
Guidance for Disclosure 201-1
Revenues
An organization can calculate revenues as net sales plus
revenues from financial investments and sales of assets.
Net sales can be calculated as gross sales from products
and services minus returns, discounts, and allowances.
Revenues from financial investments can include cash
received as:
interest on financial loans;
dividends from shareholdings;
Disclosure 201-1
Continued
royalties;
direct income generated from assets, such as
property rental.
Revenues from sale of assets can include:
physical assets, such as property, infrastructure,
and equipment;
intangibles, such as intellectual property rights,
designs, and brand names.
Operating costs
An organization can calculate operating costs as cash
payments made outside the organization for materials,
product components, facilities, and services purchased.
Services purchased can include payments to
self-employed persons, temporary placement agencies
and other organizations providing services. Costs
related to workers who are not employees working
in an operational role are included as part of services
purchased, rather than under employee wages
and benefits.
Operating costs can include:
property rental;
license fees;
facilitation payments (since these have a clear
commercial objective);
royalties;
payments for contract workers;
training costs, if outside trainers are used;
personal protective clothing.
The use of facilitation payments is also addressed
in GRI 205: Anti-corruption.
Employee wages and benefits
An organization can calculate employee wages and
benefits as total payroll (including employee salaries
and amounts paid to government institutions on behalf
of employees) plus total benefits (excluding training,
costs of protective equipment or other cost items
directly related to the employee's job function).
Amounts paid to government institutions on behalf
of employees can include employee taxes, levies, and
unemployment funds.
Total benefits can include:
regular contributions, such as to pensions,
insurance, company vehicles, and private health;
other employee support, such as housing,
interest-free loans, public transport assistance,
educational grants, and redundancy payments.
Payments to providers of capital
An organization can calculate payments to providers
of capital as dividends to all shareholders, plus interest
payments made to providers of loans.
Interest payments made to providers of loans can
include:
interest on all forms of debt and borrowings
(not only long-term debt);
arrears of dividends due to preferred shareholders.
Payments to government
An organization can calculate payments to governments
as all of the organization's taxes plus related penalties
paid at the international, national, and local levels.
Organization taxes can include corporate, income,
and property.
Payments to government exclude deferred taxes,
because they may not be paid.
If operating in more than one country, the organization
can report taxes paid by country, including the definition
of segmentation used.
Community investments
Total community investments refers to actual
expenditures in the reporting period, not commitments.
An organization can calculate community investments
as voluntary donations plus investment of funds in the
broader community where the target beneficiaries are
external to the organization. Voluntary donations and
investment of funds in the broader community where
the target beneficiaries are external to the organization
can include:
contributions to charities, NGOs and research
institutes (unrelated to the organization's
commercial research and development);
funds to support community infrastructure,
such as recreational facilities;
direct costs of social programs, including arts
and educational events.
If reporting infrastructure investments, an
organization can include costs of goods and labor,
in addition to capital costs, as well as operating costs
for support of ongoing facilities or programs. An
example of support for ongoing facilities or programs
can include the organization funding the daily operations
of a public facility.
Community investments exclude legal and commercial
activities or where the purpose of the investment is
exclusively commercial (donations to political parties can
be included, but are also addressed separately in more
detail in GRI 415: Public Policy).

Disclosure 201-1
Continued
Community investments also exclude any infrastructure
investment that is driven primarily by core business
needs, or to facilitate the business operations of an
organization. Infrastructure investments driven primarily
by core business needs can include, for example,
building a road to a mine or a factory. The calculation of
investment can include infrastructure built outside the
main business activities of the organization, such as a
school or hospital for workers and their families.
